title: Chapter 5: Identities

### The Basics

Identities are required for providing creation information about the data and
for making the voting system useful. Anima relies for their implementation
again on the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
with [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org). These identities are so called
self-sovereign identities. They are cryptographically secured
by military standards and only claimable by their owner. This differentiates
them from identities like the ones on social media platforms where the actual
provider of the platform still has a lot of power over the identity. Included
are the abilities to reset passwords and delete accounts thus erasing
the associated identities at will.
