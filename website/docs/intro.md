## What is Anima?

Anima is a network of connected graph databases called Minds. Its purpose is to store the *complete
human knowledge* to this point of time and expand it with logical operations working with the connections
between data. In other words our goal is to make the [vision](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#vision) 
of a real World Wide Web of knowledge reality.

We differentiate knowledge into two types: The mathematically correct and the arguable. Based on the 
mathematically correct knowledge we can search for unrecognized, implicit relations in our data sets.
This is done by inference machines. They also try to correlate proven knowledge with arguable data sets. 

## But why?

Today we already have a lot of knowledge available. The only problem is: Nobody knows 
how much it really is we know and where to find every bit of it. It's everywhere across the Internet. 
Unorganised, unrelated, sometimes human-, sometimes machine-readable. 

With Anima, you simply formulate a question and get not just short answers but real information.
This information is presented sensibly with charts, tables or visualisations and 
has links to other related information. You can even dig deeper to the underlying graph and 
explore every bit of data which will be all data humanity has about that specific topic.

Based on the data centric organisation information gathering gets a lot easier for machines.
Here are some examples of questions you cannot easily get answered in the current world of the complicated, 
unstructured Internet:

* Need to collect every known gene of humans and reptiles for comparison? 

No problem.

* Need to collect all physical laws relevant for dropping an apple? 

No problem, do you also want to
know why they must be true? Or do you like to have a simulation generated for this specific problem?

* Need to collect all U.S. presidents and where they were born? 

No problem, here is the map with a timeline
plus each place they have been.
